This solution leverages Power Automate, Microsoft Graph and the Microsoft Translator service/connector to automatically translate SharePoint pages. It is designed to be used alongside the out of the box SharePoint Online translations functionality. 

At the time of writing, only 'Text' Web Part content and Web Part titles are translated.

This solution is a proof of concept to demonstrate the art of the possible and may require further changes before it is used in a Production environment. 

A single user Power Automate premium plan is required to use this solution due to the use of the HTTP connector.
